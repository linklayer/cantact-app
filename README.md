# CANtact-app

CANtact-app is an open source software tool for interfacing with Controller Area
Network systems from the desktop. It is primarily intended to be used with the
[CANtact hardware](https://github.com/linklayer/cantact-hw), but should work
with any device that uses the LAWICEL protocol.
